;;; Commentary:

;; This program was inspired from a version written in 1986 by
;; Ian G. Batten <batten@uk.ac.bham.multics>, which had been derived from
;; an ancient yacc program.  Other than reusing the same sentence fragment
;; templates for the grammar below, this is a complete rewrite.

;; The comments from the original version read as follows:
;;
;;         "Flame" program.  This has a chequered past.
;;
;;         The original was on a Motorola 286 running Vanilla V.1,
;;         about 2 years ago.  It was couched in terms of a yacc (I think)
;;         script.  I pulled the data out of it and rewrote it as a piece
;;         of PL/1 on Multics.  Now I've moved it into an emacs-lisp
;;         form.  If the original author cares to contact me, I'd
;;         be very happy to credit you!

;; On 1994-01-09, I discovered that rms dropped this file from the Emacs 19
;; distribution; this was sometime before 19.7 was released.  He made no
;; ChangeLog entry and didn't keep the source file around (by convention,
;; we usually renamed files we wanted to keep but not go into official
;; distributions so that they started with `=', e.g. `=flame.el').  This is
;; all he had to say about it when I asked:
;;
;;       I think I decided I was unhappy with the legal papers for it.
;;       Removing it took less time than trying to deal with it
;;       any other way.
;;
;; At the time, I was unable to locate Ian Batten though he has sinced
;; resurfaced via the web.
