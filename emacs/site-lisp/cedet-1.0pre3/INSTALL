CEDET: Collection of Emacs Development Enviromnent Tools

CEDET is a top-level project containing several individual package for Emacs,
includeing:

   EIEIO - CLOS layer for Emacs Lisp
   Semantic - Parser Infrastructure for Emacs
   Speedbar - Everything browser
   EDE - File manager/ Makefile generator
   COGRE - Connected Graph Editor

You can install all these packagees at once with the CEDET build and
install scripts:

1) Copy source files somewhere.

2) Byte compile

   a) make

   -OR-

   b) make EMACS=<your favorite emacs>

  You might also have trouble with makeinfo.  If you need to upgrade
  makeinfo, you can do this:

  c) make MAKEINFO=/usr/local/bin/makeinfo

  Note: For speedbar, you may also need to byte-compile the version
  of INFO and RMAIL that come with your version of emacs.

  d) make MAKEINFO=echo

  To skip making the doc.

2.1) Build Issues

  If running MAKE fails due to other issues such as bad load def
  files, custom-autoload, incomprehensible run time errors during a byte
  compilation, try these steps, then go back to step 2.

  a) make clean-autoloads
  b) make clean-all

3) Install load hooks into your .emacs file.

-----------
;; Load CEDET
(load-file "~/cedet-VERSION/common/cedet.el")

;; Enabling various SEMANTIC minor modes.  See semantic/INSTALL for more ideas.
;; Select one of the following
(semantic-load-enable-code-helpers)
;; (semantic-load-enable-guady-code-helpers)
;; (semantic-load-enable-excessive-code-helpers)

;; Enable this if you develop in semantic, or develop grammars
;; (semantic-load-enable-semantic-debugging-helpers)
-----------

  Some items in the contrib directory may need additional study or
  installation.  Read contrib/INSTALL for specifics on those extra
  packages.

4) Configuration:

You can configure how the individual packages load in the above example
by adding settings in the comment section.  Please read individual
INSTALL files for each package for details on configuring them.
See the texinfo manuals for details on more specific configurations.
